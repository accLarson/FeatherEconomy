# FeatherEconomy

FeatheEconomy is a spigot plugin for adding an item based economy to minecraft servers.

Depends on Vault.

### Features

Support for MySQL/MariaDB or built in SQLite.  

### TODO:

- By default it'll use Material.LAPIS_LAZULI for transactions, this can be changed pretty easily. I should add this to the config.yml so users can change this without having to recompile.
- Permission nodes.
- PAPI support
